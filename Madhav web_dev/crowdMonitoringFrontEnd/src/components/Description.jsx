      Within Project Orion we aim to create a comprehensive system that integrates visual and IoT data for a wide range of tracking purposes. Such as individual tracking, activity recognition, overcrowding detection, collision prediction, heart rate monitoring, heatmap generation, contact tracing, alerting, historical analysis and emergency evacuation planning. We aim to combine these functionalities within a system that will provide a robust and versatile solution for monitoring and analysis across many different contexts.
