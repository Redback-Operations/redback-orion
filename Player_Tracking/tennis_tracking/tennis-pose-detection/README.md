## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing tennis player movements using pose estimation through a pretrained OpenPose model (using OpenCV's DNN module). It detects key body joints, visualizes the skeletal structure, and calculates important angles between limbs, enabling a deeper understanding of player posture and movement patterns.

## ✨ Features
- **Pose Detection** using a pretrained OpenPose model with OpenCV.
- **Joint Keypoint Extraction** from static images of tennis players.
- **Skeleton Visualization** on both the original image and a blank canvas.
- **Angle Calculation** between major body joints to analyze posture.
- **Highly Modular** code for easy experimentation and extension.

## 📊 Keypoint & Skeleton Mapping

- **Keypoints Tracked:**
  - Nose, Neck, Shoulders, Elbows, Wrists, Hips, Knees, Ankles, Eyes, Ears

- **Skeleton Connections:**  
  Connects key joints to visualize the player's pose as a skeletal structure.

---

## 📐 Angle Calculation
The following joint angles are calculated using 3-point geometry:
- Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist
- Hip-Knee-Ankle
- Neck-Shoulder-Elbow
- Neck-Hip-Knee
- Torso Width (Shoulder to Shoulder) and Hip Width (Hip to Hip)

Angles are annotated on the image and also printed in the console output for logging or debugging purposes.

---

## ⚙️ Angle Formula

```python
def calculate_angle(a, b, c):
    """
    Calculate the angle between three points (in degrees).
    
    Parameters:
        a, b, c: Points in the form of (x, y) coordinates
                 b is the vertex point
    
    Returns:
        angle: The angle in degrees
    """
    ba = a - b
    bc = c - b
    cosine = np.dot(ba, bc) / (np.linalg.norm(ba) * np.linalg.norm(bc) + 1e-6)
    return np.degrees(np.arccos(np.clip(cosine, -1.0, 1.0)))
```
