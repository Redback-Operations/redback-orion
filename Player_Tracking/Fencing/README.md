Pose and Weapon Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting player poses and weapons (such as swords in fencing) using computer vision techniques. It includes custom models for pose estimation and weapon detection, leveraging machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and YOLO.

Project Overview
The project involves:

Detecting player poses using MoveNet.
Detecting weapons using a YOLO-based model.
Real-time detection and analysis using video frames.
Main Components
main.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for integrating pose estimation and weapon detection workflows.
pose_estimation.py: Python script for detecting player poses using MoveNet.
weapon_detection.py: Python script for detecting weapons (swords) using YOLO-based object detection.
