## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and tracking AFL balls in match footage. The system identifies the ball in each video frame using bounding boxes and can optionally estimate movement patterns such as speed or trajectory.

## Features
- **Ball Detection:** Accurately detects the AFL ball in varied game contexts.
- **Tracking:** Follows the ball's position throughout match sequences.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Consistently marks detected balls.
- **Custom Dataset:** Dataset built and labeled using Roboflow, sourced from annotated AFL clips.

## Dataset
This dataset contains labeled AFL match footage frames. It was curated using Roboflow and annotated by our team.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Fast Motion:** Improved with high-frame-rate footage and diverse training samples.  
- **Small Object Scale:** Managed via zoomed-in labels and image augmentation.  
- **Occlusion:** Addressed by adding occluded examples and adjusting anchor sizes.

## Future Work
- Improve robustness under occlusion  
- Add trajectory and direction prediction  
- Develop a real-time deployment system  
- Integrate live commentary overlay
