# Pose Estimation Fitness Project

## Overview
This project uses a simplified pose estimation pipeline for fitness applications. It leverages a pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model to detect keypoints and visualize poses.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to perform pose estimation on an image:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Objectives
- Simplify pose estimation for fitness applications.
- Provide a streamlined workflow for detecting and visualizing poses.
