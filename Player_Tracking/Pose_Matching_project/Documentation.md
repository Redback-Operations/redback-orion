5. **Model<a name="_page3_x72.00_y471.00"></a> Details**

   The pose estimation model used in this project is a pre-trained TensorFlow model, specifically designed for detecting keypoints on the human body. The model identifies the following key body parts:

- **Nose**, **Neck**, **Shoulders**, **Elbows**, **Wrists**, **Hips**, **Knees**, **Ankles**, **Eyes**, and **Ears**.

The model takes an image or video frame as input and outputs the coordinates of keypoints. These points are then connected to form a skeleton of the personâ€™s pose.![ref1]

6. **Key<a name="_page4_x72.00_y72.00"></a> Functionalities![ref1]**
1. **Pose<a name="_page4_x72.00_y118.50"></a> Estimation**

Pose estimation is the process of identifying key body parts and their positions. This involves:

- Loading a pre-trained neural network for keypoint detection.
- Processing the input (image, video, or webcam feed) to extract the coordinates of each body part.
- Drawing a skeleton overlay on the original image to visualize the detected pose.

<a name="_page4_x72.00_y277.50"></a>**Code Example for Pose Estimation:**

def pose\_estimation(frame):![](Aspose.Words.0863cfc1-c31f-483d-a11c-ee3e4fb91665.003.png)

frameWidth = frame.shape[1]

frameHeight = frame.shape[0]

net.setInput(cv.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1.0, (inWidth, inHeight), (127.5, 127.5, 127.5), swapRB=True, crop=False))

out = net.forward() out = out[:, :19, :, :]

points = []

for i in range(len(BODY\_PARTS)):

heatMap = out[0, i, :, :]

\_, conf, \_, point = cv.minMaxLoc(heatMap)

x = (frameWidth \* point[0]) / out.shape[3]

y = (frameHeight \* point[1]) / out.shape[2] points.append((int(x), int(y)) if conf > thr else None)![ref1]

return points![](Aspose.Words.0863cfc1-c31f-483d-a11c-ee3e4fb91665.004.png)![ref1]

2. **Pose<a name="_page5_x72.00_y99.00"></a> Matching**

Pose matching compares the keypoints of two poses and calculates the similarity percentage based on the Euclidean distance between corresponding keypoints. This enables the system to determine how similar two poses are.

<a name="_page5_x72.00_y206.25"></a>**Code Example for Pose Matching:**

def calculate\_similarity\_percentage(keypoints1, keypoints2, ![](Aspose.Words.0863cfc1-c31f-483d-a11c-ee3e4fb91665.005.png)max\_distance=200):

total\_distance = 0

valid\_points = 0

for kp1, kp2 in zip(keypoints1, keypoints2):

if kp1 is not None and kp2 is not None:

total\_distance += np.linalg.norm(np.array(kp1) -

np.array(kp2))

valid\_points += 1

average\_distance = total\_distance / valid\_points if valid\_points > 0 else max\_distance

return max(0, 100 \* (1 - average\_distance / max\_distance))
