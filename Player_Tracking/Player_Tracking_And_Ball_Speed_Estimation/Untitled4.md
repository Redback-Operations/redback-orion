    "# Player and Ball Tracking with YOLOv8\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a real-time player and ball tracking system using the YOLOv8 model. The system is capable of detecting and tracking players and the ball in a live video feed from a cam. It also estimates the speed of the ball based on movement between frames. This solution can be particularly useful for analyzing sports footage, such as football matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-installation of Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the player and ball tracking code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opencv-python-headless\n",
    "pip install torch\n",
    "pip install ultralytics\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that you have the YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) downloaded and available in the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code requires Python 3.9 or 3.10 for compatibility with the YOLOv8 model and other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have Python 3.9 or 3.10 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv player_tracking_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "- **Windows:**\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  player_tracking_env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **macOS/Linux:**\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  source player_tracking_env/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Install Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the required Python libraries by running the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install opencv-python-headless\n",
    "pip install torch\n",
    "pip install ultralytics\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `opencv-python-headless`: Used for image and video processing without GUI support.\n",
    "- `torch`: PyTorch library, required for running YOLO models.\n",
    "- `ultralytics`: Contains the YOLOv8 implementation.\n",
    "- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, including distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Download the YOLOv8 Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) from the official [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Make sure to place this file in the same directory as your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Run the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following script to start tracking players and the ball:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cv2\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "from ultralytics import YOLO\n",
    "import time\n",

    "# Release the capture and close all windows\n",
    "capture.release()\n",
    "cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Viewing the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you run the script, a window will open displaying the live video feed.\n",
    "- The code will draw bounding boxes around detected players (in green) and the ball (in red).\n",
    "- It will also estimate and display the speed of the ball.\n",
    "- Press the 'q' key to exit the video feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Window Not Opening**: Ensure that your OpenCV installation includes GUI support (try using `opencv-python` instead of `opencv-python-headless`).\n",
    "- **YOLO Model Not Found**: Make sure `yolov8n.pt` is in the same directory as your script.\n",
    "- **Camera Not Detected**: Make sure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project uses the YOLOv8n model, which is the nano version of YOLOv8. You can replace it with other versions (e.g., `yolov8s.pt`, `yolov8m.pt`) depending on your system's computational power.\n",
    "- If you experience frame lagging, consider resizing the input frames or using a more lightweight model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or encounter any issues while setting up the project.\n"
