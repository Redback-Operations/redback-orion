## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and tracking greyhounds in races for object detection and tracking. The system highlights all the dogs in each video frame by putting a bounding box around them or identifying their number. Additionally, it calculates their relative speeds.

## Features
- **Greyhound Detection:** Accurately detects and identifies all greyhounds in each video frame.
- **Tracking and Sorting:** Tracks the positions of the greyhounds throughout the race.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws consistent bounding boxes around detected greyhounds.
- **Speed Calculation:** Calculates the relative speed of each greyhound in the race.
- **Custom Dataset:** Created and labeled a large custom dataset using Roboflow, with tasks distributed among team members for efficient data labeling.

  This visual showcases how the model consistently identifies greyhounds, tracks them across frames, and calculates their relative speeds, providing valuable insights during races.

## Test Our Public Model
You can test our public model by uploading your own videos to see how well it detects and tracks greyhounds in action. Use the link below to upload a video and test the model:

   - [Run on Google Colab](colab_training.ipynb)
     
3. **Download the Dataset:**
   - If you prefer running the project locally, use the [Roboflow dataset link](https://app.roboflow.com/ds/TYmihJNfyP?key=D4ylby1lBR) to download the training data.
      
4. **Setup YOLOv8:**
   - Follow the [YOLOv8 installation guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) to set up the detection model.

5. **Run the Detection Model:**
    - Use the following command to run the detection model:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --source path_to_your_video --weights yolov8s.pt --conf 0.25
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes a large collection of images of greyhounds, labeled and annotated using Roboflow. The dataset was created by the team, with tasks distributed among members to efficiently label each image, ensuring a high-quality dataset to improve the model's performance.

## Speed Calculation Method
The speed of greyhounds is estimated using the following steps:
1. **Detection**: YOLOv8 detects greyhounds in each video frame.
2. **Tracking**: DeepSort tracks detected greyhounds, assigning a unique ID to each.
3. **Position Tracking**: The center of each bounding box is recorded across frames.
4. **Speed Estimation**: Speed is calculated by measuring the Euclidean distance between positions in consecutive frames and multiplying by the frame rate (FPS).

**Get Speed Estimates:**
- The speed calculation is done using the distance between bounding boxes across frames and converting it to km/h. You can view the implementation in the [speed_test.ipynb](speed_test.ipynb)

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Close Proximity Detection:** Initial challenges included difficulties in detecting greyhounds when they were close together. This was mitigated by expanding the dataset and refining the model.
- **Obstruction Issues:** Detecting greyhounds behind railings or other obstacles required additional training data and fine-tuning of the model.
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed feature was added to the system, but it requires further refinement to ensure accurate measurements. The method involves calculating the distance moved by the bounding boxes of greyhounds across frames and converting it to speed in km/h.

## Future Work
- **Further Model Refinement:** Continue refining the model to enhance accuracy and robustness.
- **Speed Feature Improvement:** Improve the speed calculation feature for more accurate real-time tracking.
- **Automated Testing Pipeline:** Implement an automated testing pipeline to validate the model against new datasets.
- **Extended Features:** Explore adding features such as live commentaries.
