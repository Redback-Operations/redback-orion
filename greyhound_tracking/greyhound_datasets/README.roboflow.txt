The dataset includes 576 images.
Greyhounds-colours are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 10 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
