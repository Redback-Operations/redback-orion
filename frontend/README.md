# Redback Project 4 - Crowd Monitoring and Player Tracking

## Repository Guidelines

Beginning in the second trimester of 2024, members should follow these guidelines while working with this repository:

- **README.md Files**: All folders should contain a `README.md` (unless the folder is automatically generated, e.g., folders beginning with ".").
- **Naming Conventions**: File and folder names must not contain spaces. Use either snake_case or kebab-case. For instance, instead of "Crowd Monitoring", use "crowd_monitoring" or "crowd-monitoring". Lower-case letters are preferred, but not strictly required.
- **File Organization**: Do not store loose files at the top level of the repository unless explicitly approved.
- **Folder Structure**: Teams should work within a designated subfolder under one of the following top-level directories: Crowd-Monitoring, Player-Tracking, Internet-of-Things, or Others.
